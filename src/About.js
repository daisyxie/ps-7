        Hi and welcome! I’m a senior at the University of Washington studying Informatics with a focus in Data Science and HCI, and Communications with a focus in Digital and Tech Media. 
        Over the past three years, curiosity and uncertainty of my career interests have led me to a wide variety of experiences. From healthcare to technology to business, the changes 
        in my interests have allowed me to uncover my passions and more importantly, understand what it is I’m not passionate about. Above all, I’ve developed a strong love for leading
         and empowering others. Through my successes and failures, I’ve had the support of the community that surrounds me, the people that continue to push me to reach higher and work 
         harder. If you would like to learn more about my leadership development, check out my leadership portfolio. With that in mind, I’m hoping to find a career that will allow me to
          work at the cross-section of business, technology, and design. I want to work in an environment that allows creativity and curiosity to drive major business decisions and teamwork 
          to fuel their successes. When I'm not working on professional/personal development, you can find me at the gym (bouldering or powerlifting), at Dough Zone eating my favorite food 
          (dumplings), or traveling around the world. If you have any questions or would just like to chat, feel free to contact me at daisyxie@outlook.com or via LinkedIn! I'd love to talk!
